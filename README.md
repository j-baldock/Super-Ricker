# Super-Ricker
Quantify the influence of habitat quality on rates of superimposition and strength of density-dependence (Ricker *b*) for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT). All redd count data was collected by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. This project builds off of previous efforts to quantify the effects of [changing climate and water management on population productivity of YCT](https://j-baldock.github.io/YCT-ReddCounts-Ricker/).
